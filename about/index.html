I've spent two decades at the intersection
          of technology, data, and financial services — in global institutions, with deep
          roots in ASEAN.
</p> <p>
The work has always run from the boardroom to the build. I've shaped technology
          and data strategy with boards and executive committees, built and led the engineering
          and data organizations that execute it, and managed the partner ecosystems that help
          deliver it. The through-line is always the same: outcomes that move the business
          forward — not technology for its own sake.
</p> <p>
What's given that work an unusual dimension is having operated on both sides of
          the table. I've led technology and data organizations from inside large financial
          institutions — accountable for the platforms, the teams, the budgets, and the
          results. And I've worked on the outside as an advisor and go-to-market strategist,
          helping organizations make technology decisions and partnering to deliver them.
          The view from each side is different. Having lived both changes how you think
          about either.
</p> <p>
A recurring theme across that work is architecture — enterprise, business, and
          information &amp; data architecture. In large enterprises these aren't abstract
          disciplines. They're the connective tissue between strategy and execution, between
          what a business needs and what technology can realistically deliver — in regulated,
          complex, legacy-heavy environments where the cost of getting it wrong is high.
</p> <p>
What I keep coming back to is why technology-led transformation is so hard inside
          established institutions — and why the answers almost never have much to do with
          the technology itself. The architecture is usually the easy part.
</p> <p>
This blog is where I write to think. The topics range across cloud architecture,
          data engineering, AI strategy, and platform thinking — but the underlying question
          is usually the same: how do you make large, complex organizations actually move?
</p> <p>
I've been writing here since 2008. The topics have shifted considerably — some of
          the technologies I wrote about in the early years barely exist even as memory now.
          But looking back, the questions underneath them haven't changed much. That
          continuity tells me more about this field than any trend report.
