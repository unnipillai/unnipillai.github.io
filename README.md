## Hi, I'm Unni

Engineer. Builder. Writer.

I've spent two decades at the intersection of technology, data, and financial services — in global institutions, with deep roots in ASEAN. The work has run from the boardroom to the build: shaping technology and data strategy, leading engineering and data organizations, and managing the partner ecosystems that deliver it.

A recurring theme across that work is architecture — enterprise, business, and information & data architecture. In large enterprises these aren't abstract disciplines. They're the connective tissue between strategy and execution.

I've been writing at [unnipillai.com](https://unnipillai.com) since 2008. The topics have shifted — some of the technologies I wrote about in the early years barely exist even as memory now. But the questions underneath them haven't changed much.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/unnikrishnanpillai/) if you want to continue the conversation.
